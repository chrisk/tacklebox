(Hooks? Yeah? And you take it camping? Near the fire? Yes? OK.)

A lil' web app to act as a RESTful endpoint for your scripts that
post to Campfire. You POST, it posts.

Basic idea:

1. Setup a handler for your service (say, post-commit callbacks from GitHub)
2. Write a small template to interpolate the variables into Campfire posts

That's it.

Not much here yet--just some spiking. But I'm working on it.
